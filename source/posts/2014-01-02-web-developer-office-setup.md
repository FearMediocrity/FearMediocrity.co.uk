Inspired by [Scott Hanselman's 2014 Ultimate Developer and Power Users Tool List for Windows](http://www.hanselman.com/tools), I've decided to document the tool I use on a daily basis, starting with my office setup.

## Furniture

### Desk
The biggest change this year was returning to a standing desk. Previously, I used a standing desk when working from my home office, but since moving to a traditional office I'm usually seated.

In November I switched to a [DeskRite 200 Writing](http://www.posturite.co.uk/desks-furniture/height-adjustable-desks/deskrite-200-writing.html) from Posturite. This manually adjustable height desk gives me the option to switch positions at any time, and I tend to spend about half of the day in each position.

### Chair
No change here, as the [Markus](http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/20103101/) from Ikea has served me well since 2011.

## Hardware

### 27" iMac - Replaced
While my previous iMac, a late 2009 27" i5, served me well the opportunity to upgrade to a newer model this year proved too hard to resist. So, I'm ending the year on a late 2013 27" i7 with an upgraded graphics card, 1TB fusion drive and 24 GB of Memory. On a good day, I can go from off to "Photoshop" in under 8 seconds.

### Macbook Pro - Upgraded
While an iMac is great for the office, I find myself traveling to London almost weekly, so I upgraded my 2011 Macbook Pro to a 512 SSD, which gave the machine a whole new lease of life.

### iPad 4 to iPad Mini Retina
While I would have been happy to stick with my iPad 4, I had the opportunity to upgrade to the iPad Mini Retina which, in my opinion, has a nicer form factor and is more pleasant to read on.

### iPhone 5 - No Change
While there are some nice updates to the iPhone with the 5S model, it wasn't enough to convince me to update. However with my mobile phone contract coming up for renewal, and the iPhone 6 on the horizon, this may be upgraded in 2014.

While it's been a couple of years since I produced any site that wasn't HTML5 and CSS3, the tools used to create sites have evolved.

### DELL U2410
When working on front end code, I prefer my second monitor to be  in portrait mode, so I can see more of the page and have Firebug open at the bottom of the screen.

The Dell U2410 is perfect for those who don't always want a landscape screen, as it rotates on it's stand and allows for a resolution of 1200x1920 when in portrait mode.

## Luxuries

### Doxie GO
I've been into scanning important documents for years now, and have a digital archive of every bill, contract and bank statement for the past 5 years. When my flatbed scanner decided it was time to retire earlier this year, I picked up a [Doxie Go](http://www.getdoxie.com/product/doxie-go/), a portable scanner with an Eye-Fi card for automatically transfer scanned documents to my Mac for sorting and storage.

While the device isn't without its flaws it has proven to be a time-saver over my old flatbed scanner, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking to go paperless in 2014.

### Jawbone Up
In May, I purchased a [Jawbone UP](https://jawbone.com/up/international) to track my daily activity. I'm one of those people who would track everything they do every day if it were practical, so the idea of tracking my movement and sleep patterns appealed to me.

While I was impressed enough with the UP to buy my girlfriend one, the device itself does not stand up to the rigours of every day life, with me on my 2nd replacement and my girlfriend on her 4th.

Looking ahead, I expect that at least one of us will be trailing the [Fitbit Force](http://www.fitbit.com/force) once it's released in the UK.

### Bluetooth Headphones
I've had my FutureSoundLab's [FZL Zero](http://www.futuresoundlab.co.uk/product/fsl-zero/) for over a year now, and until recently they were trouble free. The sound quality was as good as I needed, and the lack of wires was a major plus point for me.
However, since upgrading to a new iMac and Mavericks, they seem to need repairs with the computer on a daily basis, which is more of a niggling pain than a major inconvenience.

## Plans for 2014
Aside from a potential new iPhone, I don't see many changes to this setup in 2014. If I decide to look into Android programming, I may add a device from the Nexus range to my collection, and a Cinema display isn't 	 out the question. But as things stand right now, I'd be happy to keep this setup well in to 2015.
