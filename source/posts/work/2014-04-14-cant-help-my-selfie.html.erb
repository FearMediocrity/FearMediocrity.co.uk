    <h2>About this project.</h2>
  </header>

  <p>In early 2014 French Connection engaged Somewhat to create a campaign for their Spring / Summer collection.</p>

  <p>The campaign was to run in their London stores, along with online and social media elements.</p>

  <p>The result launched as #CANTHELPMYSELFIE in May 2014. The campaign encouraged patrons to use a special booth to take selfies whilst modeling the latest fashions.</p>

  <p>Once submitted the participants would photos would be on display in the store front, and on the website to compete for votes.</p>

  <p>The campaign was a success, and had it's run extended to tour around other French Connection stores in the UK.</p>

    <h2>My Involvement</h2>
  </header>

  <p>The project came in many parts, from an Android App to take the photos to a Node.js app for real time voting. I was the main web developer on the project, and was responsible for:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>Ruby on Rails Application</h3>
      <p>The bulk of the web development was a Ruby on Rails 4.1 app.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h3>Front End Development</h3>
      <p>Developed using the latest HTML5 and CSS3 standards the site was responsive and optimised for a short page load time.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
