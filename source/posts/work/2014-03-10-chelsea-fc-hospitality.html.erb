    <h2>About this project.</h2>
  </header>

  <p>In mid 2012, Chelsea engaged Somewhat to build an app to cater to their hospitality guests whilst at Stanford Bridge.</p>

  <p>The resulting app allows guests to keep track of the action both on an off the pitch. Real time commentary is generated by manupliating data provided by Opta. The app syndicated news from the official Chelsea F.C website. The app also presents a selection of exclusive offers and benefits to the user.</p>

    <h2>My Involvement</h2>
  </header>

  <p>I was the lead web developer on this project. I created two component systems to meet the required functionality.</p>

  <ul class="skills">
    <li class="ruby">
      <h3>Ruby on Rails Application</h3>
      <p>I created a Ruby on Rails 4.0 application to create the main backend system. This part of the system managed content, handled user accounts, and scaled as required.</p>
    </li>

    <li class="ruby">
      <h3>Ruby Command Line Application</h3>
      <p>I created a Ruby command line app to receive data files from Opta in XML format via FTP, and process them in to suitable content. Once processed the data used a private API in the main Ruby on Rails app to pass the data.</p>
    </li>

  </ul>
