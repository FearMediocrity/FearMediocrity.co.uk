## About the project

In early 2014 French Connection engaged Somewhat to create a campaign for their Spring / Summer collection.

The campaign was to run in their London stores, along with online and social media elements.

The result launched as #CANTHELPMYSELFIE in May 2014. The campaign encouraged patrons to use a special booth to take selfies whilst modeling the latest fashions.

Once submitted the participants would photos would be on display in the store front, and on the website to compete for votes.

The campaign was a success, and had it's run extended to tour around other French Connection stores in the UK.

## My Involvement

The project came in many parts, from an Android App to take the photos to a Node.js app for real time voting. I was the main web developer on the project, and was responsible for:

##Ruby on Rails Application
The bulk of the web development was a Ruby on Rails 4.1 app.

##Front End Development
Developed using the latest HTML5 and CSS3 standards the site was responsive and optimised for a short page load time.
